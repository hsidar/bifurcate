This webapp is used to divide the bills evenly between two people.

To add entries you would go to the add tab and import a CSV file obtained from your banking website.

The website will then itemize the entries allowing the user to tag them with their own custom made tags (ex: electricity, groceries, restaurants) and then save the entries to the database.
